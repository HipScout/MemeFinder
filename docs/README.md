## Script: `run.sh`

Runs the flask server on `localhost:5000` in development mode.

## Script: `add.sh`

Adds subreddits to the web scraping list.

## Script: `collect.sh`

Collects memes from the subreddits in `Meme.txt`.

## Script: `tkrun.sh` (DEPRECATED)

Runs the deprecated tkinter application.

---

## Directory: `lib/`

Contains the files required for searching through the database.

### File: `standard.py`

Renames the memes present in `raw/` folder to a unique hex-digest generated filename and moves it to `processed/` folder.

### File: `ocr.py`

Extracts text using Tesseract OCR from the meme from the `raw/` folder.

### File: `search.py`

#### `generate_query_db(query)`

Extends the query to include all synonyms related to the input query using nltk package.

#### `create_index_db()`

Creates an new collection of all memes stored in the database, where the __filename__ is used as `key` and __associated text__ as `value`. Along with that `score` field is added to map ranking in `get_score_db()`

#### `update_required()`

Checks if there is update in data and correspondingly calls `create_index_db()`

#### `get_score_db(keywords)`

Creates a relevance based score list matched with the filenames in collection `INDEX` for the given `keywords`

### File: `util.py`

Used for the flask application.
Use the functions here for a higher level abstraction of the project.

#### `get_memes(query)`

Returns list of meme files from the database based on the `query`.

### File: `meme_gui.py` (DEPRECATED)

Starts the deprecated Tkinter GUI of the project.
Will be removed in the future.

### File: `meme_gui_support.py` (DEPRECATED)

Will be removed in the future.

#### Class: `meme`

Contains vital information like `memeList` and `currentImage` and the object of this class is very important in the functioning of the GUI.

#### `getMemeList(query)`

Gets the list of memes which match the given `query`.

#### `display(canvas, image_path)`

Displays the image at `image_path` on the `canvas` in the GUI.

#### `go(canvas, query)`

Initiates all the process essential for the GUI to function. It gets the memeList ready based on the entered `query` and also dispays the first meme on the `canvas`.

#### `prev(canvas)`

Displays the previous image on the `canvas`.

#### `next(canvas)`

Displays the next image on the `canvas`.

---

## Directory: `scraper/`

Contains files related to the web scraping part of the project.

### File: `api.py`

Finds a list of meme subreddits using reddit REST api. Stores the list in `scraper/Meme.txt`.

### File: `scraper.py`

Scraps meme images from the subreddits in `scraper/Meme.txt` and stores them in `processed/` directory.

**NOTE: Documentation Pending.** Need to document the functions.

---

## Directory: `database/`

Store for the txt-based comma separated databases.

## Directory: `processed/`

This is a store for image files with standardised file names.
*Will be created after running `collect.sh`*

## Directory: `raw/`

This is a store for image files from web scraping.
*Will be created after running `collect.sh`*
